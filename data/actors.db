It drove him to ruthlessly work his way up through the ranks of Ganymede&rsquo;s criminal gangs, using his unusual strength and size to his advantage. When he was a lieutenant and a leg-breaker for other bosses, people tended to underestimate his intellect and ambition, but few people underestimate Aquilo now. He has an up-and-coming reputation on the station as a man who can make things happen, who can&nbsp; articularly acquire things and get them where they need to be, for a price. Kai caught Aquilo&rsquo;s eye and the crime boss says and thinks that he loves him, in his own fashion. The things is, love is just another name for ownership to Aquilo, and Kai is just a prized possession. He wants his paramour back, but Aquilo can&rsquo;t put up with any disloyalty, and if he can&rsquo;t have Kai, then nobody is going to have him. Orn Aquilo is tall like most Belters but surprisingly broad as well, powerfully muscled, with dark brown hair and a full beard that splits into an easy, savage grin.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">His dark eyes are fiery when he&rsquo;s feeling in good humor or angry.
