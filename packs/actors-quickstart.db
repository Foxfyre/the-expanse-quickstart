It&rsquo;s the way things are. The rich and powerful have and take what they want, and the rest of the system lives off whatever scraps fall from their table. Parvati has learned where to find and collect all of the best scraps, so much so that she can afford to sell some to those able to pay, and maybe have the potential to begin changing the game a little. Like a lot of Belters aligned with the Outer Planets Alliance, Parvati is tired of the exploitation of the Inner Planets, and wants to give the Belters a seat at the table rather than lurking under it.</p>\n<p>Moneta&rsquo;s goal is to build her power base on Ganymede Station, sensing that big things are happening. After Eros, chances are good the Inner Planets will go to war at any time, and that will be when the OPA and the Belt can act. Of course, one of the obstacles in Moneta&rsquo;s way is Orn Aquilo&rsquo;s influence over the black market on Ganymede, but now fate has offered her leverage against Aquilo along with some valuable cargo in the bargain. The crime boss&rsquo;s latest boy-toy wants out, and is willing to betray his lover to get it, which suits Parvati just fine.</p>\n<p>Parvati Moneta has the tall, thin build of a Belter, her heritage primarily South Asian and Mediterranean. Her straight black hair is worn long on one side, almost completely shaved on the other, and she bears a Belter neck tattoo as well as an OPA split circle on her right bicep. Moneta is lean and graceful and particularly good with a knife in close combat; she always carries at least two concealed on her person.</p>","stunts":"the upper hand, lightning attack, skirmish","talent1":"contacts (novice), inspire (novice), pistol style (novice)","talent2":"","equipment1":"hand terminal, knives, light armour, pistol","equipment2":""},"token":{"name":"Parvati Moneta","img":"modules/the-expanse-quickstart/NPC/parvati_moneta_token_2.png","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.fortune"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"lightColor":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"XlBSrQZLsJRFWKkt","name":"Knife","type":"weapon","img":"systems/the_expanse/ui/item-img/item-light_melee.png","data":{"name":"","type":"light_melee","group":"","attack":"","npcattack":"","usefocus":true,"usefocusplus":false,"damage":1,"hasBonusDamage":false,"bonusDamage":0,"rangemin":"0","rangemax":"0","range":"","cost":6,"equipped":false,"description":"<p>Light weapons tend to be quick and easy to wield, lending themselves to a fast and agile fighting style.
